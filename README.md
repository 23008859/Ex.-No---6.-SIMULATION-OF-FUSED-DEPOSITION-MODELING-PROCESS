## DATE: 27.11.23
## AIM:
### To simulate the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process.

## REQUIREMENTS:
### System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:
### STEP 1: Click on 'Base'. Base and Build Platform will be displayed on the left side of the screen.
### STEP 2: Click on 'Extruder' then extruder and extruder nozzle will be displayed.
### STEP 3: Click on 'Material Spool' then material spool will be shown.
### STEP 4: Click on 'Filament' then filament will be added.
### STEP 5: Click on 'Start Process' to begin the process.
### STEP 6: After the process is complete click on 'Stop Process' to view product generated using FDM process.

# Explantion:
1. The foam base is placed on the build platform of the 3D printer.
2.The build platform is heated to the appropriate temperature to ensure proper adhesion of the printed object.
3.The filament is fed into the extruder, where it is melted and extruded onto the build platform.
4.The extruder nozzle moves along the X and Y axes, depositing the molten material onto the build platform according to the G-code instructions.
5.As the nozzle moves, it deposits the molten material in a series of parallel lines, forming the first layer of the object.
6.Once the first layer is complete, the build platform lowers slightly to create space for the next layer.
7.The process of material extrusion, nozzle movement, platform lowering, and material cooling repeats until the entire object is formed.
8.Once the print is complete, the build platform is cooled and the printed object is removed

# Explantion:
1.The filament spool is loaded into the filament feeder.
2.The filament is fed into the extrusion head, where it is melted.
3.The extrusion nozzle moves along the X and Y axes, depositing the melted filament onto the foam base according to the G-code instructions.
4.As the nozzle moves, it deposits the molten material in a series of parallel lines, forming the first layer of the object.
5.Once the first layer is complete, the build platform lowers slightly to create space for the next layer.
6.The process of material extrusion, nozzle movement, platform lowering, and material cooling repeats until the entire object is formed.
7.Once the print is complete, the build platform is cooled and the printed object is removed.

# Explantion:
1.Place the foam base on the build platform of the 3D printer.
2.Heat the build platform to the appropriate temperature to ensure proper adhesion of the printed object.
3.Start the printing process.
4.As the extruder nozzle deposits the molten filament onto the build platform, the foam base will help to insulate the build platform and reduce warping.
5.Once the print is complete, the build platform will cool and the printed object can be removed.

# Explantion:
1.The filament is a thin strand of thermoplastic material that is used to print the object. 
2.The filament spool is loaded into the filament feeder of the 3D printer.
3.Filament is the thermoplastic material used in fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing. 
4.It is a thin strand of plastic, typically with a diameter of 1.75mm or 2.85mm, that is fed through a heated nozzle and deposited onto a build platform layer by layer to create a 3D object.

# Explantion:
1.Once all preparations are complete, start the printing process through the printing software.
2.Monitor the print closely during the initial layers to ensure proper adhesion and filament flow.
3.Adjust the print settings if necessary to optimize print quality and address any issues that may arise.

# Explantion:
1.Once the print is complete, allow the extruder nozzle to cool down to prevent filament from solidifying in the nozzle.
2.This can be done by setting the extruder temperature to a low temperature or by turning off the printer's power.
3.Once the extruder nozzle has cooled down, unload the filament from the printer.
4.Remove the printed object from the build platform. Be careful not to bend or break the object.
5..Clean the build platform with an appropriate solvent, such as isopropyl alcohol, to remove any leftover filament or adhesives.
